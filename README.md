# Tf_Linear_model
This project demonstrate creation and implementation of linear model by tensorflow to predict second hand car price prediction.

Dimensions were adjusted accordingly of X(training attributes) and y(target label) split by using tensorflow tools.

Training, validation and test dataset were made.
Linear model is made by Sequential after normalization and multiple layers were added in model to enhance final results.

Model is then compiled and is trained.

Accuracy and plotting is done to detemine accuracy of our model prediction
